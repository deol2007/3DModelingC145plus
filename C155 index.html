<!-- We can calculate the distance between them. 
  That’s a way to detect whether the two entities are in contact. 
  But that is a long way to write the collision algorithm for all the entities in the scene. 
  For this, A-Frame provides collision detection events that can be triggered whenever two entities in the A-Frame scene interact. 


  The objects must follow physics laws in nature like gravity, collision, etc.
   how we implemented physics in earlier classes? 
   We used a library called matter.js, which had predefined physics functionalities 
   for the bodies.


   A-Frame provides components that can be attached to the entities to make the physical bodies in the 3D scene. 
   These components are a part of the A-Frame physics system library of their own- “aframe-physics-system” 
   which is built using CANNON.js, the JavaScript physics engine library, to render the physics-based 3D scenes. 
   Just like matter.js is for 2D, CANNON.js is for 3D scenes. 
   To understand how the physics components work, we first need to include this A-Frame library in the index.html <head> tag. 
    Then we will quickly add a few entities to the demo scene.
