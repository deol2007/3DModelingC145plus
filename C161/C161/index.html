    <!-- to find a way to get the camera's direction and use that as the direction to shoot the bullet. 
  This can be done with the help of a predefined method in the Three.js library. 
  
  Let's discuss a bit about the relationship between A-Frame and Three.js. 
  We know that A-Frame is built on Three.js (which means that when we use A-Frame, 
  it is Three.js that is working behind the scenes). We need to see how we can access 
  any object or function present in Three.js using A-Frame. A-Frame’s <a-scene> is mapped 
  with a Three.js scene. 
  The Three.js scene is accessible from the <a-scene> element as .object3D. 
  A-Frame’s <a-entity> is mapped to one or more Three.js objects. 
  Every A-Frame entity (<a-entity>) has its own THREE.Object3D.-->

    This code is creating a camera and a shooter (weapon) entity in the virtual reality scene. 
    The camera is positioned at (0, 1.6, 0) and has the ability to move using the wasd-controls and look
    around using the look-controls. 
    The shooter entity is a 3D model of a gun that is loaded in from
    an external file using the gltf-model attribute. It is positioned at (0, -4.4, 3) and 
    has a rotation of (0, 180, 0) and a scale of (0.35, 1, 1). 
    Additionally, a cursor is added to the camera entity to allow the user to interact with the virtual reality scene.

    which means that the texture of the plane will be repeated 5 times in both the x and y

    at the center of the scene with a height of 1 unit above the ground. The `rotation` attribute is
    set to "-90 0 0", which means that the plane is rotated 90 degrees around the x-axis so that it
    lies flat on the ground. The `height` and `width` attributes are set to 200 units, which means
    that the plane is a large square. The `color` attribute is set to "#FBF2D4", which is a light
    beige color. The `static-body` attribute is set to "true", which means that the plane is a
