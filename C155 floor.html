<!-- 
 we can use two components of this A-Frame library which can initiate the physics simulation in the scene: 
 static-body component and dynamic-body component. 

 static-body: These are fixed-position objects (or animated objects). 
 Static bodies are not affected by gravity and collisions, 
 but these can interact with other objects in the scene. 

 dynamic-body: These are freely moving objects. 
 Dynamic bodies have mass, and they fall if gravity is enabled and bounce off or collide with other objects. 
 When we make torus and sphere dynamic, they fall due to gravity. 
 When the floor is made static, the torus and the sphere collide with it. 


 You see the torus and sphere bouncing off the box for some time and then coming to rest instead of passing 
 through the box. Now, when objects/bodies come in contact in the real world, there is always some friction, 
 restitution (and other physical properties) between those two bodies. 

 Friction is a force between any bodies in contact. 
 Restitution is the property that tells about the bounciness of the body. 

 In A-Frame, these properties of physics can be configured using the physics component. 
 We will set these properties globally to all the physics bodies in the scene.

      <!--  In A-Frame,  we see  shapes and modify them. To the colliding shape, 
        we can use the “debug” property and set it to true. The default shape of the collider comes 
        automatically based on the object. The default shape of the collider can be changed with the help 
        of the shape property of the dynamic and static body components. We will modify the shape around 
        the torus from box to sphere. For this, we can set the shape to a sphere. 
        And if we want to modify the radius of the collider sphere, we can use sphereRadius property. -->
