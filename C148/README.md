3D models are stored in the for of polygons. For example, like a set of triangles, which is called a mesh.

This information can be stored in the form of vertices, edges, or faces, depending on the application. Now, to store 3d models the file formats used are .obj , .fbx, .gLTF , or .glb . 

We are going to use gLTF in 3D models in A-frame. 

gLTF stands for graphics language transmission format. It is a standard file format for 3D modeling.

Asset managment in A-frame:
1) <a-assets>
2) <a-asset-item>
3) <audio>
4) <img>
5) <video>
